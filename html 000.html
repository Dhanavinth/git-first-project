<p>Test Cricket is the longest and a declining format of the sport of cricket, considered the game's most traditional form. It is a format of international cricket where two teams in white clothing, each representing a country, compete over a match that can last up to five days with six hours of play each day. It consists of four innings (two per team), maximum of 90 overs are scheduled to be bowled per day making it the sport with the longest playing time. A team wins the match by outscoring the opposition in the batting or bowl out in bowling, otherwise the match ends in a draw.

    It is contested by 12 teams which are the full-members of the International cricket council (ICC). The term "test match" was originally coined in 1861-62 but in a different context.[1] Test cricket did not become an officially recognised format until the 1890s, but many international matches since 1877 have been retrospectively awarded Test status. The first such match took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in March 1877 between teams which were then known as a Combined Australian XI and James Lillywhite's XI, the latter a team of visiting English professionals. Matches between Australia and England were first called "test matches" in 1892. The first definitive list of retrospective Tests was written by South Australian journalist Clarence P. Moody two years later and, by the end of the century, had gained acceptance.Virat Kohli is the most successful test captain of INDIA</p>

<p>
    The aim of the game is to score more runs over the course of two innings than the opposing team. An innings is over when either 10 of the 11 batsmen are out or, if the captain believes they have enough runs and chooses to declare.

<h2><font color=blue>MOTO</font></h2>
<p>The motto of Test cricket is that it's "the ultimate test of a player's and team's ability". The name comes from the fact that a five-day Test match is a "test" of the relative strengths of the two teams.</p>
